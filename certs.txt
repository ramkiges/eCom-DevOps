cd /etc/pki/tls/certs/ && cat localhost.crt      --- need to be generated and changed (need to take backup when replacing with new generated key)

comment  :   W/R/T tickets like https://jira.wsgc.com/browse/MEAD-15702 - 
             you might as well do all brands at the same time, unless you have a very compelling reason otherwise.  
             In the dp directory of the certs repo thereâ€™s a script dp-csr-group which will do this for you - give it the name of the env (ev uat4) 
             and it will generate a CSR that covers all brands.  
             Run it a second time after generating the cert and it grab the cert out of your ~/downloads directory,
             add it to git, and if you add the install argument, it will also install them for you.
